  [b]Sample mod[/b]. Adds a new campaign mode. Available through the new button in the main menu. Starts a chain of province liberations using a quest different from the main game. Liberations occur in a single stage, every enemy is visible immediately and you need to fulfill a quota of high value targets and secondary targets. The new mode loops indefinitely.
